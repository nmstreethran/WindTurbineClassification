\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my academic supervisor, Dr Nick Bennett, Assistant
Professor at Heriot-Watt University, and my industrial supervisor, Dr Iain
Dinwoodie, Senior Asset Performance Engineer at Natural Power, for their
endless guidance and feedback, and making this project possible. Special
thanks to the Technical team of Natural Power for giving me the opportunity to
work on this project with them. Thanks to everyone else at Natural Power's
Stirling office and my course mates, Raphaela Hein and In√©s Ontillera, for
making this placement an enjoyable experience. Last but not least, a big
thank you to my parents for supporting me throughout my studies.

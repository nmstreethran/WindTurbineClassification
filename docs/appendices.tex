  \caption{Power curves for turbine 1 used in selecting the pitch angle threshold. a is the original power curve. In b, data points with a pitch angle not equal to 0\,\textdegree between 90\,\% and 10\,\% power were filtered out, which distorts the power curve shape. In c, all data points have a pitch angle between 0\,\textdegree and 3.5\,\textdegree, which removes most curtailment and anomalous points while maintaining the typical power curve shape. In d, all data points have a pitch angle between 0\,\textdegree and 7\,\textdegree, which allows some curtailment points to appear. Therefore, it was decided that the filter used in c is the most suitable.}

  \caption{Power curves for turbine 24 used in selecting the power threshold before cut-in speed. a is the original power curve. b is the power curve with a filter applied to remove all data points with power > 0 kW before the cut-in speed of 3 m/s. Anemometer wind speeds, which were used to plot these power curves, are not an accurate measure of the wind speed incident on the turbine blades. Therefore, a threshold of 100 kW before cut-in is applied, which maintains the power curve shape for all 25 turbines while removing anomalous points, such as the ones in turbine 2's power curve.}

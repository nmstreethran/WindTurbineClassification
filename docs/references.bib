  abstract = {Unscheduled or reactive maintenance on wind turbines due to component failures incurs significant downtime and, in turn, loss of revenue. To this end, it is important to be able to perform maintenance before it's needed. By continuously monitoring turbine health, it is possible to detect incipient faults and schedule maintenance as needed, negating the need for unnecessary periodic checks. To date, a strong effort has been applied to developing Condition monitoring systems (CMSs) which rely on retrofitting expensive vibration or oil analysis sensors to the turbine. Instead, by performing complex analysis of existing data from the turbine's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, valuable insights into turbine performance can be obtained at a much lower cost. In this paper, data is obtained from the SCADA system of a turbine in the South-East of Ireland. Fault and alarm data is filtered and analysed in conjunction with the power curve to identify periods of nominal and fault operation. Classification techniques are then applied to recognise fault and fault-free operation by taking into account other SCADA data such as temperature, pitch and rotor data. This is then extended to allow prediction and diagnosis in advance of specific faults. Results are provided which show success in predicting some types of faults.},

  abstract = {We propose a computationally simple anomaly detection method that assists operators of offshore wind parks with monitoring the operation of wind turbines. Previously published methods focus on creating high quality predictive models for specific physical operational aspects of turbines, like power production or temperatures of the gearbox in relation to wind speed and other exogenous factors. SCADA systems of wind turbines typically provide many more sensor data time series than are being used for monitoring purposes. We show how this data can be used to automatically learn a large number of simple models that in sum can alert the operator about a variety of potentially defect related changes in different components. A number of different insights applicable to similar problems are provided in the conclusions. The system was developed and applied in an offshore wind park and is used to support predictive maintenance.},

  abstract = {The ever increasing size of wind turbines and the move to build them offshore have accelerated the need for optimised maintenance strategies in order to reduce operating costs. Predictive maintenance requires detailed information on the condition of turbines. Due to the high costs of dedicated condition monitoring systems based on mainly vibration measurements, the use of data from the turbine supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is appealing. This review discusses recent research using SCADA data for failure detection and condition monitoring (CM), focussing on approaches which have already proved their ability to detect anomalies in data from real turbines. Approaches are categorised as (i) trending, (ii) clustering, (iii) normal behaviour modelling, (iv) damage modelling and (v) assessment of alarms and expert systems. Potential for future research on the use of SCADA data for advanced turbine CM is discussed.},

  abstract = {The development of electrical control system faults can lead to increased mechanical component degradation, severe reduction of asset performance, and a direct increase in annual maintenance costs. This paper presents a highly accurate data driven classification system for the diagnosis of electrical control system faults, in particular, wind turbine pitch faults. Early diagnosis of these faults can enable operators to move from traditional corrective or time based maintenance policy towards a predictive maintenance strategy, whilst simultaneously mitigating risks and requiring no further capital expenditure. Our approach provides transparent, human-readable rules for maintenance operators which have been validated by an independent domain expert. Data from 8 wind turbines was collected every 10 minutes over a period of 28 months with 10 attributes utilised to diagnose pitch faults. Three fault classes are identified: “no pitch fault”, “potential pitch fault” and “pitch fault established”. Of the turbines, 4 are used to train the system with a further 4 for validation. Repeated random sub-sampling of the majority fault class was used to reduce computational overheads whilst retaining information content and balancing the training and validation sets. A classification accuracy of 85.50 \% was achieved with 14 human readable rules generated via the RIPPER inductive rule learner. Of these rules, 11 were described as “useful and intuitive ” by an independent domain-expert. An expert system was developed utilising the model along with domain knowledge, resulting in a pitch fault diagnostic accuracy of 87.05 \% along with a 42.12 \% reduction in pitch fault alarms. 1.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTDeployment of larger scale wind turbine systems, particularly offshore, requires more organized operation and maintenance strategies to ensure systems are safe, profitable and cost-effective. Among existing maintenance strategies, reliability centred maintenance is regarded as best for offshore wind turbines, delivering corrective and proactive (i.e. preventive and predictive) maintenance techniques enabling wind turbines to achieve high availability and low cost of energy. Reliability centred maintenance analysis may demonstrate that an accurate and reliable condition monitoring system is one method to increase availability and decrease the cost of energy from wind. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop efficient and cost-effective condition monitoring techniques for wind turbines. A number of commercial wind turbine monitoring systems are available in the market, most based on existing techniques from other rotating machine industries. Other wind turbine condition monitoring reviews have been published but have not addressed the technical and commercial challenges, in particular, reliability and value for money. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap and present the wind industry with a detailed analysis of the current practical challenges with existing wind turbine condition monitoring technology.

  doi = {10.1109/TSTE.2011.2167164},
  abstract = {Power curves constructed from wind speed and active power output measurements provide an established method of analyzing wind turbine performance. In this paper it is proposed that operational data from wind turbines are used to estimate bivariate probability distribution functions representing the power curve of existing turbines so that deviations from expected behavior can be detected. Owing to the complex form of dependency between active power and wind speed, which no classical parameterized distribution can approximate, the application of empirical copulas is proposed; the statistical theory of copulas allows the distribution form of marginal distributions of wind speed and power to be expressed separately from information about the dependency between them. Copula analysis is discussed in terms of its likely usefulness in wind turbine condition monitoring, particularly in early recognition of incipient faults such as blade degradation, yaw and pitch errors},

For each level, the emerging faults are predicted 5–60~min before they occur. Various data-mining algorithms have been applied to develop models predicting possible faults. Computational results validating the models are provided. The research limitations are discussed.},
